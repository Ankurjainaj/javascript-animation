🎨 JavaScript Animation Project

This is my first project using JavaScript, where I experimented with creating animations on a webpage.
The goal was to get hands-on practice with DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and JavaScript timers/events.

✨ Features

Simple webpage with interactive animations

JavaScript-driven movement and effects

Beginner-friendly code, easy to understand and extend

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling and basic animation support

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) for dynamic behavior and animations

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-animation-demo.git
cd js-animation-demo

2. Open the Project

Just open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
No server setup is required.

📂 Project Structure
.
├── index.html     # Main page
├── style.css      # Styles for the animation
└── script.js      # JavaScript logic for animation

🎬 Demo

Press a button (or trigger an event) to start the animation

Objects will move, bounce, or change style dynamically

Edit the code in script.js to experiment with your own animations

🧑‍💻 What I Learned

How to link JavaScript with HTML & CSS

Using setInterval() / requestAnimationFrame() for animations

Manipulating DOM elements dynamically

Debugging with browser developer tools

🔮 Future Improvements

Add multiple animated objects

Smooth transitions with easing functions

User-controlled animations (start/stop/reset buttons)

Explore Canvas API or GSAP.js for advanced animations
